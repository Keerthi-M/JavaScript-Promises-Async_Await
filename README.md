# JavaScript-Promises-Async_Await
Promises and Async Await concepts of JavaScript are used to solve the problems defined in this repository.
#####  Problem description solved in this repository: 
<h3> 1. Promises </h4>
Description:
Define a function which returns a string as a promise. If the
millisecond at that instance is divisible by the 4th index of the prime
number array, then it should resolve the promise as “​success! ”, or
else it should reject the promise as “Better luck next time!”. Get the
promise response and print it in the console!

Instructions:
1. You can use any package in js to get the millisecond.
2. Code should be properly commented and should explain the
block well.
3. Camel Spacing (naming convention) should be used to declare
variables and function names.

Restrictions:
1. You should not use Async Await.
2. No third party libraries should be used.

<h3> 2. Async Await </h4>
Description:
Define two functions which return promise. One should resolve
only one random number between -1000 and +1000 and another one
should resolve if the sum of the two random numbers generated
using the first promise is positive or else, it should be rejected as
negative. If positive, print in the console as “​User Logged in
successfully!” or else it should print in the console as “Oops! try
again!​”.

Instructions:
1. You should use Async Await.
2. Code should be properly commented and should explain the
block well.
3. Camel Spacing (naming convention) should be used to declare
variables and function names.

Restrictions:
1. Use only Math class to get the random number.
2. No third party libraries should be used.
